# Information
The story begins in the town of Mercichi: a quiet, but diverse settlement at the tip of the second-largest of the peninsulas of [[Places/Regadda/Mercichi/The Horned Lands\|The Horned Lands]]. The town was first founded by a group of adventurers who had reached the peak of their power and decided to retire while they still had their lives. Fittingly, the town tends to attract and pump out powerful adventurers.
